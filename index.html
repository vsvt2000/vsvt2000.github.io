     <p>This Elective Management system aims to bring about an easier way for the teachers and their 
      departments to put up their electives and for students to choose them by viewing the available electives
      and the admins to mediate and oversee these operations.<br></br>
      The student,teacher and the admin each have their own dashboard where their required facilities are provided.
      With the automation of the allocation and realloacation (after change in students preferences), it provides a 
      hassle free expreience for the student, teacher and the administrator.<br></br>
      The students can choose the electives from the list provided with the guidance of the ratings by the batch who 
      attended the course before them. They also get an email or a notification whenever the forms open.<br></br>
      The teachers need not worry about getting the list they would received the final copy.<br><br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stack used:</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>ReactJS</li><li>NodeJS</li><li>MySQL</li><li>ExpressJS</li></ul>

     <div class="content">
     <p>Outcome based education(OBE) is a common methodology adopted by institutes of higher learning. 
      This aids in bringing out the best from the programs that these institutes provide to students. 
      As a part of this process, various analyses is done to understand the level to which the Teaching-Learning process has been effective, and for accreditors to inspect and accredit the program. 
      This has been commonly implemented in a data oriented manner. 
      The proposed work intends to amalgamate this approach along with a faculty oriented approach, such that it not only brings out the analyses, but it also simplifies the overall process. 
      A part of the proposed work involves a stack based approach to extract properties of questions, such as Course Outcomes(COs), Bloom’s Taxonomy levels(BTLs), Difficulty levels(DLs), Total marks, and store it in the Database. 
      The other part includes the attainment calculations for each course, and the analyses for each course based on various attributes. 
      A stack which comprises Python and its libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Flask, has been used to implement and experiment on the same.<br><br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stack used:</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Python</li><li>Flask</li><li>MySQL</li><li>HTML/CSS/JS</li></ul>

           <p>Named after their inventor Adelson, Velski & Landis, AVL trees are height balancing binary search tree. AVL tree checks the height of the left and the right sub-trees and assures that their difference is not more than 1. This difference is called the Balance Factor. <br>
            <br>This page has been developed to facilitate students from various
            backgrounds to efficiently learn about a slightly complex data structure, AVL tree.
            With our effective animations and user friendly interface helps students to not only try out multiple test cases and visualize the
            rotations but also, to quickly learn and apply these concepts. <br><br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools used:</b><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>Rapydscript/JS</li><li>Flask</li><li>Python</li></ul></p>    </div>
